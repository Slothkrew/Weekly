# File Upload

## 1

The file upload page allows you to easily backdoor the server by uploading a PHP file of your choice. After uploading our shell (`shell.php`), we can send our commands to the server as a GET parameter.

## 2

The second example blocks the `.php` extension with a regular expression. A case sensitive regular expression. `shell.PHP` to the rescue!
