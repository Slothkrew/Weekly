# Attacking Rails Applications

> This little article aims to give an introduction to the topic of attacking
Ruby on Rails applications. It's neither complete nor dropping 0day. It's
rather the authors attempt to accumulate the interesting attack paths and
techniques in one write up. As yours truly spend most of his work on Ruby
on Rails applications in the time when Rails version 3 was current, some of
the described techniques are not applicable to Rails 4 any more. However
there is still a broad attack surface of older applications as migrating
Rails code up one or two version appears to be a real pain in the ass for
lager projects (if you doubt this ask your local Rails startup peeps :) ).
