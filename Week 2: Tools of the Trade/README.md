# Slothkrew Weekly 2: Tools

Tools! If there's anything cool that you think people might want to know about, or a feature of a common tool you think needs more exposure, this is the week to write short reviews, tutorials, etc.

Each tool should get its own file in this folder called tool_name.md. `snake_case` preferred. Currently in here:

 * nmap
 * netcat
 * Burp Suite
