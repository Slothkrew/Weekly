Weekly Reading Club
======
Slothkrew's weekly reading club, formerly 'Slothkrew Weekly', is our very own, highly elitist circle of avid readers of documents related to the field of information security.

Policies / procedures / 'How shit works'
=======
* Each week on Monday a designated person picks a paper / an article that will be the subject of this weeks' attention
* The paper, along with a short, descriptive README gets pushed to this very repository
* The topic of the week is to be freely discussed in our IRC channel
* This week's designated person picks the person who's reponsible for next week
* Everybody gets to learn something new.

You can find us in **#slothkrew** on Freenode, for more information feel free to check our homepage, **[slothkrew.com](https://slothkrew.com)**. Feel free to join us! If you have something you'd like to suggest we should read (Why are you not joining us already?) please fork and pull-request (No, seriously. Join us.).
