# SQL Injection

## 1

This is the standard case of SQL injection. There are two params which are inserted directly into the query string, which is then executed.

`' OR 1=1 -- `

## 2

This is a similar example, except the developer has checked that only one record is returned.

`' OR 1=1 LIMIT 1 -- '`
