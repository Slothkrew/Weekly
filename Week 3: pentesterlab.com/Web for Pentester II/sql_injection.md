# SQL Injection

## 1

This is the standard case of SQL injection. There are two params which are inserted directly into the query string, which is then executed.

`' OR 1=1 -- `

## 2

This is a similar example, except the developer has checked that only one record is returned.

`' OR 1=1 LIMIT 1 -- '`

## 3

In this example, they are escaping any `'` in the input strings. However, if you simply insert a `\` in the username field, this causes it to treat the entire query up until the first ' from the password as the username. You can then complete your injection in the password field.

username: `\`
password: ` OR 1=1 -- `

## 4

Another case of unsanitised input from the URL going into a WHERE statement. The fun thing to do here is use `UNION ALL SELECT username, password, null FROM users` to get the big list of password hashes.
