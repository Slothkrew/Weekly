# SQL Injection

## 1

The injection here is simply done at the name parameter. However, we cannot simply insert the SQL we want and comment out the rest. `mysql_query` does not allow it. As such, however we change the query, it must end with some manner of string comparison, as the injection is in one.

`http://localhost:31337/sqli/example1.php?name=root' OR 'x'='x`

## 2  

This challenge is the same, except the server will reject your request if it contains a space. Fortunately for us, spaces are not always necessary for SQL injection. A tab (`%09`) or newline (`%0A`) instead of a space will work just as well.

## 3

Rather than just blocking `/ /`, the filter now blocks `/\s+/`, which is the regex one or more whitespace characters.

Inexplicibly, the query can also be broken up with comments, like so: `root'/**/OR/**/'x'='x'`

## 4

This is the same as the first one, except it's comparing a number instead of a string. This basically just means that we don't have to worry about closing any apostrophes.

`http://localhost:31337/sqli/example4.php?id=1%20OR%201=1`

## 5

In this, they've added a little filtering, but all it accomplishes is that the parameter must START with a number.

They have written `/^[0-9]+/` when they presumably meant `/[^0-9]+/`.

## 6

The filter is now `/[0-9]+$/`, meaning you can inject anything so long as it ENDS with a number.

## 7

The filter here requires that the input both starts and ends with a number. However, you can see that the regex is also in multi-line mode. This enables us to split the regex over multiple lines to meet the rest of the requirements.

`http://localhost:31337/sqli/example7.php?id=2%0AOR%0A1=1`
